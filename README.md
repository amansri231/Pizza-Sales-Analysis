# Pizza-Sales-Analysis
This repository contains the SQL project on the Analysis of Pizza Sales.

Objective:- The primary goal of this project is to analyze the Pizza Sales by utilizing the SQL queries from basics to advanced. For carrying out the analysis on the dataset of Pizza Sales, we would be solving around 13 questions that help to make better analysis and prediction and become the most useful for the organization to make data-driven decisions.

* This SQL project makes use of 4 CSV files named order_details.csv, orders.csv, pizza_types.csv, and pizzas.csv.
* First of all, we import all the CSV files into the MySQL server, and then we start writing SQL queries using the concept
  of Join, Group By, Order By, Limit, Subqueries, and different functions such as COUNT, SUM, & ROUND.
